1. OVERVIEW

This command line application "mbtSearch" contains functions for loading
sets of binary vectors (fingerprints) into a search tree and perform fast
similarity matching. As measure of similarity can be applied as Tanimoto-
or Hamming-Coefficient. The search tree's data structure and algorithms
are based on a combination of 1DGrid, Symdex, Multibit Tree, Union Tree
and XOR-folding as discribed in the articles referenced below.

2. COMPILATION

The standalone version of multibitTree is provided with a simple makefile.
Change into the folder where the source files and the "Makefile" are located
and enter:

	make

The executable "mbtSearch" will be built.


3. GETTING STARTET

In order to print the built-in help enter:

	./mbtSearch -h

In order to run a simple test enter:

	./mbtSearch -i test/AA.csv -m 0.95 test/BB.csv
